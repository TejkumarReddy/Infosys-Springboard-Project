Infosys Internship Project

Project Overview

This repository contains the project work completed as part of the Infosys Internship Program under the guidance of the Internship Coach. The project was completed by Chandana G N and consists of two key components:

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Implementation - A neural network project.

Task 1 and Task 2 - Various exercises or tasks related to the project.

Files in the Repository

CNN.ipynb

This notebook includes code implementations for building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

The CNN is likely used for tasks such as image classification or pattern recognition.

Code cells focus on model architecture, training, and evaluation.

Task1&2.ipynb

This notebook contains implementations for Task 1 and Task 2 of the project.

Specific exercises or analysis are performed here.

Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow/Keras (assumed based on CNN implementation)

Jupyter Notebook

Other libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib (if applicable).

How to Use the Project

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-link>

Install the required libraries:

pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib

Run the notebooks using Jupyter:

jupyter notebook

Open the CNN.ipynb or Task1&2.ipynb file and execute the cells sequentially.
